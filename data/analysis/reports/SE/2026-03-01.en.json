Shopee segment $4.91B, Monee $1.12B.\n- Feb 19: Google AI partnership expanded to all three business lines. Shopee co-developing an agentic shopping prototype, Monee piloting the Agent Payments Protocol (AP2), Garena gaining Google AI access for game development. This maps directly to revenue-generating assets, not a vague announcement.\n- The $1B buyback authorization is management stating directly that the stock is undervalued. The market sold off 6.5% on it, interpreting it as a lack of high-return growth opportunities.\n- Bull case: Shopee holds 52% of SE Asia e-commerce GMV, three times TikTok Shop at 18%. Monee loan book grew 70% to $7.9B serving 34 million borrowers. Net income up 145%. PEG at 0.40 and P/FCF at 15x are rare for a company growing 35%+.\n- Bear case: Sea has missed consensus EPS by an average of 16% across the past four quarters. Morgan Stanley cut to $209 from $215, BofA to $182 from $200. Both SMA50 ($129) and SMA200 ($154) sit above the current price.\n\nConclusion: A beat on $0.90 EPS with improved Q1 guidance could trigger the re-rating the fundamentals have long implied.

          "text": "Sea Limited $108.45. Q4 earnings are two days out on March 3.\n\n- Consensus EPS revised up to $0.90 from $0.62 (+45% YoY). Revenue expected at $6.78B (+36.3%). Shopee segment $4.91B, Monee $1.12B.\n- Feb 19: Google AI partnership expanded to all three business lines. Shopee co-developing an agentic shopping prototype, Monee piloting the Agent Payments Protocol (AP2), Garena gaining Google AI access for game development. This maps directly to revenue-generating assets, not a vague announcement.\n- The $1B buyback authorization is management stating directly that the stock is undervalued. The market sold off 6.5% on it, interpreting it as a lack of high-return growth opportunities.\n- Bull case: Shopee holds 52% of SE Asia e-commerce GMV, three times TikTok Shop at 18%. Monee loan book grew 70% to $7.9B serving 34 million borrowers. Net income up 145%. PEG at 0.40 and P/FCF at 15x are rare for a company growing 35%+.\n- Bear case: Sea has missed consensus EPS by an average of 16% across the past four quarters. Morgan Stanley cut to $209 from $215, BofA to $182 from $200. Both SMA50 ($129) and SMA200 ($154) sit above the current price.\n\nConclusion: A beat on $0.90 EPS with improved Q1 guidance could trigger the re-rating the fundamentals have long implied. Conservative investors may prefer to wait for confirmation. RSI 33.68 oversold, 52-week low $99.50 is technical support. Consensus target $189 (+75%)."

Shopee holds 52% of Southeast Asia's e-commerce GMV, three times the share of TikTok Shop at 18%. Monee's loan book grew 70% to $7.9B, now serving 34 million borrowers. Garena bookings up 51%.

But four quarters of missing by 16% on average are a real pattern. Morgan Stanley cut to $209 from $215. BofA cut to $182 from $200. Both still say Buy.\n\nPEG 0.40. P/FCF 15x. Net cash $5.66B. SMA50 $129, SMA200 $154 both sit above. RSI 33.68 oversold. 52-week low $99.50 is the technical floor.\n\nThe thesis has not changed. The proof is two days away."

    "With Q4 earnings two days out on March 3, Sea Limited sits at the center of a high-stakes setup. Consensus EPS has been revised up sharply to $0.90 from $0.62, representing 45% year-over-year growth. Revenue expectations stand at $6.78B (+36.3%). The print will either validate the bull case or extend the pattern of persistent disappointment.",
    "The February newsflow was broadly constructive. Sea's Google AI partnership expanded to all three business lines: Shopee co-developing an agentic shopping prototype, Monee piloting the Agent Payments Protocol (AP2), and Garena gaining early access to Google AI for game development. This is not a vague partnership announcement , it maps directly to Sea's revenue-generating assets. The $1B share buyback authorization, while briefly triggering a 6.5% selloff on market skepticism, is a clear statement that management views current prices as deeply discounted.",
    "The bull case is compelling on paper. PEG at 0.40 and P/FCF at 15x are rare metrics for a company growing revenue at 35%+. Shopee commands 52% of Southeast Asian e-commerce GMV, three times the share of its nearest rival. Monee's loan book has expanded 70% to $7.9B serving 34 million borrowers. All 12 analysts covering the stock maintain Buy or better, with an average target of $189 , 75% above current levels.",
    "The bear case centers on execution risk. Sea has missed consensus EPS by an average of 16% in each of the past four quarters. Morgan Stanley and BofA both reduced their price targets in recent weeks. The stock sits below both the 50-day SMA ($129) and 200-day SMA ($154), with RSI at 33.68 , technically oversold but in a confirmed downtrend. Macro headwinds, including inflation surprises and EM currency weakness, continue to limit multiple expansion.",
    "The March 3 print is the defining event. A beat on $0.90 EPS with encouraging Q1 commentary could catalyze the re-rating that fundamentals have long warranted. Conservative investors may prefer to wait for confirmation. At $108.45, the stock trades near its 52-week low of $99.50 , which has acted as technical support."

          "text": "Sea Limited says: \"We are buying back $1 billion of our own stock.\"\n\nMarket: -6.5%.\n\nThe logic: if you are buying back stock instead of investing in growth, maybe growth is slowing.\n\nThe counter-argument: EPS consensus just went from $0.62 to $0.90. Google AI is now embedded in all three of their businesses. And RSI is at 33.68.\n\nMarch 3 is the referee. Current: $108.45. Target: $189 (+75%). Pick your side."

And the stock is down 46% from its high.\n\nThat is disorienting.\n\nHere is what is actually happening: the company keeps growing. Net income up 145%. Monee's loan book at $7.9B, up 70%. Garena bookings up 51%. Management is confident enough to buy back $1B in stock. Google just deepened the AI partnership across every business.\n\nThe market has been wrong about the fundamentals for a while. March 3 Q4 earnings (EPS $0.90, +45% YoY) is the moment when results have to speak louder than sentiment.\n\nTarget: $189 (+75%). RSI: 33.68. Support: $99.50. The thesis is intact , it just needs the proof."

    "description": "Originally a Bitcoin mining equipment and hosting company, Bitmine pivoted to an Ethereum treasury strategy after Tom Lee (Fundstrat co-founder) joined as chairman in June 2025. The core business model is raising capital through equity and convertible note offerings to acquire ETH. The company now holds approximately 4.37 million ETH (3.62% of total supply), making it the world's largest publicly listed ETH holder. Weekly purchases totaled a record 62,722 ETH ($123.25M). Envestnet Asset Management invested $5.56M (107,076 shares) on 2/23, and Stevens Capital initiated a 42,563-share position on 2/21. Meanwhile, leadership concerns have emerged: CFO Raymond Mow departed in December 2025, and President Erik Nelson was terminated in January 2026. Tom Lee presented three secular ETH demand drivers at Consensus Hong Kong 2026: Wall Street tokenization, AI agent adoption, and proof-of-human L2 standards.",

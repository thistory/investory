    "description": "Originally a Bitcoin mining equipment and hosting company, Bitmine pivoted to an Ethereum treasury strategy after Tom Lee (Fundstrat co-founder) joined as chairman in June 2025. The core business model is raising capital through equity and convertible note offerings to acquire ETH. The company now holds approximately 4.38 million+ ETH (3.6%+ of total supply), making it the world's largest publicly listed ETH holder. On 2/22, it added another 10,000 ETH ($19.49M), bringing the weekly total to a record 72,722+ ETH ($140M+). Institutional accumulation continues with Morgan Stanley (12.1M shares), ARK Invest (9.4M shares), BlackRock (+166%), Goldman Sachs (+588%), and Stevens Capital initiating a new position on 2/21.",

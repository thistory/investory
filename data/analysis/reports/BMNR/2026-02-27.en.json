  "overallOpinion": [
    "BMNR is the world's largest public ETH holder, offering leveraged crypto exposure via equities. The P/B of 0.78x represents an attractive NAV discount, but extreme share dilution (+4,158% YoY) is the biggest risk.",
    "ETH's rebound to $2,026 is helping holdings value recover. Once MAVAN staking launches in Q1, annual revenue of $252M+ would transform BMNR from a pure asset holder to a revenue-generating enterprise.",
    "The key variables are ETH price trajectory and dilution pace. For those with high ETH conviction, it offers leveraged upside — but you must accept dilution risk vs. simply buying ETH directly."

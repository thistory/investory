    "description": "Originally a Bitcoin mining equipment and hosting company, Bitmine pivoted to an Ethereum treasury model after Tom Lee (Fundstrat co-founder) joined as chairman in June 2025. The core business is raising capital through equity and convertible bond issuances to acquire ETH, currently holding approximately 4.37 million ETH (3.62% of total supply) — making it the world's largest publicly traded ETH holder. On 2/21, the company added 17,722 ETH ($34.74M), bringing the weekly total to an aggressive 62,722 ETH ($123.25M). Institutional buying continues with Morgan Stanley (12.1M shares), ARK Invest (9.4M shares), BlackRock (+166%), Goldman Sachs (+588%), and Stevens Capital initiating a new position on 2/21.",

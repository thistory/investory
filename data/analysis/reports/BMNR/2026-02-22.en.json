    "description": "Originally a Bitcoin mining equipment and hosting company, Bitmine pivoted to an Ethereum treasury strategy after Tom Lee (Fundstrat co-founder) joined as chairman in June 2025. The core business model is raising capital through equity and convertible note offerings to acquire ETH. The company now holds approximately 4.37 million ETH (3.62% of total supply), making it the world's largest publicly listed ETH holder. On 2/21, it added another 17,722 ETH ($34.74M), bringing the weekly total to an aggressive 62,722 ETH ($123.25M). Institutional accumulation continues with Morgan Stanley (12.1M shares), ARK Invest (9.4M shares), BlackRock (+166%), Goldman Sachs (+588%), and Stevens Capital initiating a new position on 2/21.",

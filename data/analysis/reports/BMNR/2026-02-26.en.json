Trading at a discount to NAV at ETH $1,905. Tom Lee recently stated on CNBC that 'crypto looks like it is bottoming now' and presented 3 structural ETH demand drivers at Consensus Hong Kong 2026.",

    "Trading at P/B 0.71x (29% NAV discount) and surging +10.29% today on ETH's rebound, MAVAN staking is generating $176M annual passive income — creating value beyond simple 'crypto holding'.",
    "However, YoY share dilution of +4,158%, an 87% decline from 52-week highs, and ROE of -86% present extreme risks. This is a high-risk, high-reward position suitable only for investors with strong conviction in Ethereum's future."

    "Bitmine is executing the 'MicroStrategy of Ethereum' strategy but faces the reality of $8B+ unrealized losses. ETH at $1,958 is half the estimated average cost basis of $3,800.",
    "Positives include Tom Lee's leadership, accelerating accumulation by 419 institutions, MAVAN staking's revenue potential, and a dominant market position controlling 3.66% of ETH supply.",
    "However, an 88% decline from 52-week highs, executive departures (CFO and president), and ongoing share dilution are serious risks. Further ETH decline could endanger financial health.",
    "This stock is essentially a 'leveraged ETH bet.' For investors who believe in ETH's long-term value, it offers an asymmetric return opportunity. Otherwise, it's an extremely high-risk investment. Only small, diversified positions recommended."

    "description": "Tesla is rapidly transforming from an EV manufacturer into an integrated AI, robotics, and energy platform company. FY2025 revenue was $94.8B, marking the first-ever annual revenue decline (-2.9%), with net income plunging 46.5%. However, on 2/17 the first Cybercab production unit rolled off the line at Giga Texas, bringing the robotaxi era closer to reality. FSD cumulative miles surpassed 8.2 billion. The Netherlands RDW granted FSD Supervised approval, opening European expansion. Meanwhile, European sales declined for 13 consecutive months, and the $243M Autopilot verdict overturn attempt was rejected. Model S/X discontinuation is confirmed for Q2 2026, with Fremont converting to Optimus robot production.",

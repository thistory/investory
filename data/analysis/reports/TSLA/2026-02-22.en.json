    "description": "Tesla is rapidly transforming from an EV manufacturer into an integrated AI, robotics, and energy platform company. FY2025 revenue was $94.8B, marking the first-ever annual revenue decline (-3%), with net income plunging 61%. However, on February 17, the first production Cybercab unit rolled off the line at Giga Texas, bringing the robotaxi era closer to reality, and FSD cumulative miles surpassed 8.2 billion. The Netherlands' RDW granted FSD Supervised regulatory approval in February using an EU Article 39 national exemption, opening the path for broader European rollout. Meanwhile, safety concerns around the robotaxi service have emerged (Fortune reported a crash rate 4x that of human drivers), alongside a California DMV settlement to stop Autopilot marketing and a $243M jury verdict being upheld. Tesla's $2B investment in xAI, followed by a SpaceX-xAI merger that excluded Tesla, has intensified shareholder lawsuits over conflicts of interest. Model S/X discontinuation is confirmed for Q2 2026, and the Fremont line is being converted to an Optimus robot factory.",

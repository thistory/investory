    "description": "Tesla is rapidly transforming from an EV maker into an integrated AI, robotics, and energy platform. FY2025 revenue was $94.8B, marking the first-ever annual revenue decline (-2.9%), with net income dropping 46.5%. The first Cybercab production unit rolled off Giga Texas on 2/17, making the robotaxi era a reality. FSD cumulative miles surpassed 8.2 billion, and the Netherlands' RDW approved FSD Supervised for the EU. Baird upgraded to Outperform with a $548 target. Meanwhile, China delivery times collapsed to 1-3 weeks as Tesla extended its financing promo through Q1, and the company counter-sued California's DMV over FSD false advertising claims.",

First unit off the line 2/17, mass production April. It exists. But Musk himself called the initial ramp 'agonizingly slow.' The Netherlands RDW gave FSD its first EU approval, and energy FY2026 is projected to grow 26.6%. These matter for the long run\n- The demand picture is the most painful part.

Baird Outperform ($548), RBC Buy ($500), Wedbush ($600) anchor the bull side with a long-term thesis centered on Cybercab, FSD monetization, and energy scaling. On the other side, JPMorgan holds a Sell at $145 and Philip Securities at $215. The consensus of $408 and a growing Hold count signal a market stuck in wait-and-see mode.\n\nThe nearest-term catalyst is Cybercab April mass production. The first unit rolled off Giga Texas on February 17. However, Musk himself cautioned the initial ramp will be 'agonizingly slow,' and federal regulations for unsupervised driverless vehicles remain unfinished. The Netherlands RDW granting the first EU approval for FSD Supervised, and energy segment FY2026 growth projected at 26.6%, remain genuine long-term tailwinds.\n\nDemand is collapsing on two critical fronts. In China, January domestic sales fell 45% year-over-year, and Xiaomi's YU7 outsold Model Y by more than 2-to-1. In Europe, five major markets dropped 44% in January, with Norway down 88%, marking 13 consecutive months of decline. Musk's DOGE involvement and far-right political endorsements destroyed brand value from $43B to $27.6B in a single year, a 36% erosion of one of Tesla's most durable assets.\n\nMacro headwinds are piling on. US-EU trade tensions and potential reciprocal tariffs threaten international revenue. The California DMV counter-suit and the $243M upheld Autopilot verdict keep legal risk elevated.\n\nClose $401.80, -19% from 52-week high ($498.83)\nBelow 50d SMA ($440.94) and 200d SMA ($418.30)\nRSI 42, no rebound momentum\nP/E 369x, Forward P/E 193x.

They are not wrong about the long-term direction. Cybercab is real, the first unit rolled off 2/17. Energy revenue grew 27% and is projected to grow 26.6% more in FY2026.

Xiaomi's YU7 SUV outsold Model Y by more than 2-to-1. Delivery times collapsed to 1-3 weeks, and the financing promotion keeps getting extended, which signals demand weakness, not buyer urgency.\n\nEurope is not much better. Five major markets fell 44% in January. Norway dropped 88%. That is 13 consecutive months of decline. Musk's DOGE involvement and far-right endorsements have destroyed brand value from $43 billion to $27.6 billion in a single year, a 36% collapse.\n\nCybercab April launch matters. But Musk himself said the initial ramp will be 'agonizingly slow.' And the path to fully unsupervised operation still requires federal regulatory clearance that does not yet exist.\n\nUS-EU trade tensions and tariff risk are building. The California DMV counter-suit and the $243M Autopilot verdict add legal uncertainty. JPMorgan Sell at $145 and Philip Securities Sell at $215 exist for reasons that do not disappear because Baird says $548.\n\nThe 50d SMA ($440.94) and the 200d SMA ($418.30) both sit above the current price.

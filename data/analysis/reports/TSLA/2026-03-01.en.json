    "description": "Tesla is rapidly transforming from an EV maker into an integrated AI, robotics, and energy platform. FY2025 revenue was $94.8B, marking the first-ever annual revenue decline (-2.9%), with net income dropping 46.5%. The first Cybercab production unit rolled off Giga Texas on 2/17, making the robotaxi era a reality. FSD cumulative miles surpassed 8.2 billion, and the Netherlands' RDW approved FSD Supervised for the EU. Baird upgraded to Outperform with a $548 target. Meanwhile, China delivery times collapsed to 1-3 weeks as Tesla extended its financing promo through Q1, and the company counter-sued California's DMV over FSD false advertising claims.",

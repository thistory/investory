    "description": "Tesla is rapidly transforming from an EV manufacturer into an integrated AI, robotics, and energy platform company. FY2025 revenue was $94.8B, marking the first-ever annual revenue decline (-2.9%), with net income plunging 46.5%. However, on 2/17 the first Cybercab production unit rolled off Giga Texas, bringing the robotaxi era closer to reality. FSD cumulative miles surpassed 8.2 billion, and the Netherlands RDW granted FSD Supervised approval, opening European expansion. European sales declined for 13 consecutive months, and the $243M Autopilot verdict overturn attempt was rejected. Model S/X discontinuation confirmed for Q2 2026, with Fremont converting to Optimus robot production. On 2/24, Tesla website code revealed a 2026 Model 3 interior upgrade (black headliner, 16-inch QHD display).",

    "Tesla is at peak 'vision vs reality' divergence. Growth catalysts like Cybercab's first production and FSD EU approval are materializing, but FY2025 revenue decline, 13 consecutive months of European sales drops, and 384x P/E coexist.",
    "Short-term, positioned in a neutral zone below the 50-day SMA ($439) and above the 200-day SMA ($389). RSI 43.55 approaching oversold. Cybertruck price cuts and Model 3 upgrades may help form a demand floor.",
    "Consensus target $396 implies -4.5% downside. However, bull case ($550-600) assumes robotaxi/Optimus success. Suitable for long-term investors who can tolerate high volatility; risky for short-term trading."

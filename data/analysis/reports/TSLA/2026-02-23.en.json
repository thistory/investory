    "description": "Tesla is rapidly transforming from an electric vehicle manufacturer into an integrated AI, robotics, and energy platform company. FY2025 revenue came in at $94.8 billion, marking the company's first-ever annual revenue decline (-3%), while net income plunged 61%. However, the Cybercab's first production unit rolled off the line at Giga Texas on February 17, bringing the robotaxi era closer to reality. FSD cumulative miles surpassed 8.2 billion. The Netherlands' RDW granted FSD Supervised regulatory approval in February, opening a pathway for European expansion. Meanwhile, robotaxi safety concerns have intensified (Fortune: 4x human crash rate, plus 5 recent additional collisions), alongside the California DMV's Autopilot marketing settlement and a $243M jury verdict. Model S/X discontinuation is confirmed for Q2 2026, with Fremont transitioning to Optimus robot production.",

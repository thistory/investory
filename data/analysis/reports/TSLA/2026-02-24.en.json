    "description": "Tesla is rapidly transforming from an EV manufacturer into an integrated AI, robotics, and energy platform company. FY2025 revenue was $94.8B, marking the first-ever annual revenue decline (-2.9%), with net income plunging 46.5%. However, on Feb 17 the first Cybercab production unit rolled off the line at Giga Texas, bringing the robotaxi era closer to reality. FSD cumulative miles surpassed 8.2 billion. The Netherlands RDW granted FSD Supervised approval, opening European expansion. Meanwhile, the Austin robotaxi service has logged 14 crashes since launch (4x human crash rate), the $243M Autopilot verdict was upheld, and California DMV reached a marketing settlement. Model S/X discontinuation is confirmed for Q2 2026, with Fremont converting to Optimus robot production.",

Cybercab production and FSD European approval are strong catalysts, but a Forward P/E of 195x requires flawless execution across all fronts. The 14 robotaxi crashes (4x human rate), $243M lawsuit loss, and first-ever revenue decline are real risks. Trading below both 50-day and 200-day moving averages signals technical weakness. Suitable only for investors with strong conviction in the long-term vision. Near-term, the $400 support level is the key battleground.",

    "description": "Tesla is rapidly transforming from an EV manufacturer into an integrated AI, robotics, and energy platform company. FY2025 revenue came in at $94.8B, marking the first-ever annual revenue decline (-2.9%), with net income plunging 46.5%. However, the first Cybercab unit rolled off Giga Texas on 2/17, making the robotaxi era a reality. FSD cumulative miles surpassed 8.2 billion, and the Netherlands' RDW approved FSD Supervised, opening the door to European expansion. European sales fell for the 14th consecutive month (-17% YoY in January), and Grok AI was deployed to European Tesla vehicles via OTA. TSLA closed at $408.58 on 2/26, down -2.11%.",

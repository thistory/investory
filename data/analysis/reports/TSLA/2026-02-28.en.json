    "description": "Tesla is rapidly transforming from an EV maker into an integrated AI, robotics, and energy platform. FY2025 revenue was $94.8B, marking the first-ever annual revenue decline (-2.9%), with net income dropping 46.5%. However, the first Cybercab production unit rolled off Giga Texas on 2/17, making the robotaxi era a reality. FSD cumulative miles surpassed 8.2 billion, and the Netherlands' RDW approved FSD Supervised, opening the door for European expansion. European sales have declined for 14 consecutive months (January YoY -17%). On 2/27, the stock fell 1.45% to $402.67 amid inflation shock and Musk Epstein subpoena concerns.",

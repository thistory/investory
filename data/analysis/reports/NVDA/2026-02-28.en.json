    "description": "NVIDIA is the world's largest semiconductor design company, with AI training and inference data center accelerators as its core revenue driver. Market cap ~$4.31T. Q4 FY2026 results released 2/25 — revenue $68.13B (+73% YoY, beating consensus $66.2B), EPS $1.62 (beating $1.53). Q1 FY2027 guidance $78B (±2%) exceeded consensus $72.6B by $5.4B. Data center revenue $62.3B (+75% YoY). 13th consecutive earnings beat. However, the stock fell 9.5% over two days to $177.29, driven by 'sell the news,' AI bubble fears, and an inflation surprise.",

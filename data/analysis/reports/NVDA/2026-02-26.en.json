    "description": "NVIDIA is the world's largest semiconductor design company, with AI training and inference data center accelerators as its core revenue driver. Market cap ~$4.77T makes it one of the world's most valuable companies. On 2/25, NVIDIA reported Q4 FY2026 results after market close — revenue $68.13B (+73% YoY, beating consensus $66.2B), EPS $1.62 (beating consensus $1.53). Q1 FY2027 guidance of $78B (±2%) massively topped consensus $72.6B by $5.4B. Data center revenue hit $62.3B (+75% YoY). Net income reached $43B, nearly doubling year-over-year. This marks the 13th consecutive earnings beat. The stock rose up to +4% in after-hours before settling around +1%. CEO Jensen Huang said 'customers are racing to invest in AI' and indicated an OpenAI partnership agreement is imminent.",

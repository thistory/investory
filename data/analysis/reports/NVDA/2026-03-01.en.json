    "Trump tariff anxiety extended NVIDIA's post-earnings slide, with shares falling an additional 1.88% to $181.45 on February 28. The cumulative three-session loss following the earnings report now stands at 7.2%, and both the 50-day SMA ($186.43) and the 200-day SMA ($183.86) have been surrendered  -  a technically bearish setup in the short run.",
    "Yet the next major catalyst is right around the corner. GTC 2026 runs March 16-19 in San Jose, where Jensen Huang is expected to officially reveal the Rubin (R200) architecture  -  a generational leap promising roughly 5x the performance of Blackwell. GB300 shipments are on track to surge 129% year-over-year in 2026, with agentic AI demand providing a structural tailwind that the earnings report corroborated.",
    "Wall Street's institutional consensus has not moved. JPMorgan's Harlan Sur called the stock a 'coiled spring'; Goldman Sachs reiterated $250 and a Buy; Barclays held its $275 Overweight. Sixty of 64 covering analysts remain at Buy, with a consensus target of $272  -  implying roughly 50% upside from current levels.",
    "The tariff risk and technical damage are real short-term headwinds. But Forward P/E at 21x and PEG at 0.54 for a company growing revenue at 55%-plus annually is an anomaly by historical standards. The $183 level (200-day SMA) is the key recovery line to watch; GTC 2026 is the event most likely to catalyze a reclaim.",
    "RSI approaching 38 signals the stock is nearing oversold territory. Near-term support sits at $176. For investors with a multi-month view, the current zone offers a risk-reward skewed to the upside, particularly ahead of a potentially re-rating event in two weeks."

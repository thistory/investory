With a market capitalization of approximately $4.67 trillion, it ranks among the world's most valuable companies. The Q4 FY2026 earnings report is just 3 days away on February 25. A multi-year, multi-generation strategic partnership with Meta was officially announced, and Blackwell Ultra (GB300) has achieved 50x throughput improvement over Hopper. Negotiations for a $30B investment in OpenAI are nearing completion. In Q3 FY2026, NVIDIA delivered record results with $57B in revenue (+62% YoY) and $51.2B in data center revenue (+66% YoY).",

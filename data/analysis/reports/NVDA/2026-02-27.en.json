    "description": "NVIDIA is the world's largest semiconductor design company, with AI training and inference datacenter accelerators as its core revenue driver. Market cap ~$4.49T. On 2/25 after market close, Q4 FY2026 results were released — revenue $68.13B (+73% YoY, beating consensus $66.2B), EPS $1.62 (beating $1.53 consensus). Q1 FY2027 guidance of $78B (±2%) crushed the $72.6B consensus by $5.4B. Datacenter revenue hit $62.3B (+75% YoY). 13th consecutive earnings beat. Yet on 2/26, shares fell -5.46% to $184.89 — reflecting AI competition concerns and 'sell the news' sentiment.",

    "Palantir opened March 1 at $133.85, extending a bruising year-to-date decline of roughly 24% as AI software valuations face a broad market reassessment. The Pentagon's decision to tap Google Gemini as the backbone of its new GenAI.mil platform added to the anxiety, raising questions about whether government AI budgets will increasingly be spread across multiple vendors rather than concentrated in Palantir's platforms.",
    "The fundamental picture, however, tells a different story. The DHS $1 billion five-year blanket purchase agreement, fresh DISA authorization for IL5/IL6 edge deployments, the UK's largest-ever Palantir defense contract, and a new Rackspace partnership for regulated industries all arrived in recent weeks. Q4 revenue grew 70% year over year to $1.407 billion, and 2026 guidance of $7.18-7.20 billion (+61%) significantly exceeded Street expectations. Citi maintains a Strong Buy at $260, and the analyst consensus target sits at $188-189, implying 41% upside from current levels. TipRanks views the selloff as an opportunity.",
    "The technical picture is the clearest bear case: PLTR is trading below its 5-day ($133.79), 20-day ($142.38), and 50-day ($165.19) moving averages, with a bearish MACD and an RSI of 37-38 that is approaching oversold territory but has yet to produce a confirmed reversal signal. At 35% below the 52-week high of $207.52 and still priced at roughly 213x trailing earnings, the stock sits in a precarious middle ground , strong underlying business, deteriorating near-term technicals, and a valuation that leaves little margin for error. For long-term investors, the current zone may represent a phased accumulation opportunity; for short-term traders, the path of least resistance remains downward until technical momentum turns."

The implication that government AI budgets might fragment is unsettling, even if Palantir's classification-level clearances are in a different league.\n\nThe company itself keeps delivering. DHS $1B five-year BPA across six agencies on no-bid procurement. DISA IL5/IL6 edge authorization. UK's largest-ever defense contract. Q4 revenue $1.407B, up 70%. US commercial $507M, up 137%. 2026 guidance $7.18-7.20B, up 61%.\n\nRSI is at 37-38, approaching oversold. The 5-day ($133.79), 20-day ($142.38), and 50-day ($165.19) are all overhead. P/E 213x, PEG 2.30. Consensus is $188, which is 41% above where PLTR trades now. Citi sees $260. At 35% below the 52-week high of $207.52, the math for phased buying is starting to make sense."

          "text": "Palantir opened March 1 at $133.85, extending a 24% year-to-date decline.\n\nThe biggest new variable today: the Pentagon selected Google Gemini as the backbone of its GenAI.mil platform. That raises real questions about whether government AI budgets will spread across multiple vendors instead of concentrating in Palantir. Palantir argues its classification-level clearances are a different category entirely, but the market is clearly unnerved.\n\nThe contract pipeline tells a different story. The DHS $1 billion five-year blanket purchase agreement (signed 2/19) covers CBP, ICE, Secret Service, FEMA, TSA, and CISA, all without competitive bidding. DISA authorized Palantir Federal Cloud Service Forward for IL5/IL6 edge deployments, shortening the pilot-to-production runway for defense customers. Add the UK's largest-ever Palantir defense contract, an Australian DoD deal worth $7.6M, and a new Rackspace partnership for regulated industries.\n\nFundamentals remain top-tier. Q4 revenue hit $1.407B (+70% YoY), with US commercial surging to $507M (+137% YoY). The 2026 guidance of $7.18-7.20B (+61%) significantly beat prior Street estimates, confirming AIP adoption is compounding.\n\nTechnicals are the clearest bear case. PLTR is trading below its 5-day SMA ($133.79), 20-day ($142.38), and 50-day ($165.19). RSI sits at 37-38, approaching oversold but without a confirmed reversal. MACD is bearish. At P/E 213x and PEG 2.30, there is little margin for error.\n\nAnalyst consensus target is $188 (+41% upside). Citi holds Strong Buy at $260, UBS and Daiwa at $180. At 35% below the 52-week high of $207.52, the case for phased accumulation builds, but the path of least resistance remains down until technical momentum turns."

          "text": "Palantir's Q1 2026 press releases read like a highlight reel: DHS $1B five-year BPA, DISA IL5/IL6 edge authorization, UK's largest defense contract ever, Australian DoD deal, Rackspace partnership for regulated industries. Q4 revenue was $1.407B, up 70%. US commercial up 137%.\n\nThe stock is down 24% year-to-date.\n\nThe plot twist that broke the chart today: Google Gemini landed inside the Pentagon's GenAI.mil platform. The market immediately asked the question Palantir holders have been dreading: if the DoD uses Gemini for its AI platform, is Palantir's government moat narrower than the P/E of 213x implies?\n\nCiti thinks the answer to that is $260. Consensus says $188, which is 41% above today's price. RSI is at 37. The 52-week high is $207.52, which is 35% away. PEG is 2.30.\n\nSomething has to give. The only question is what moves first."

          "text": "Being down 24% on a position in two months is not easy. If you are holding Palantir right now, here is an honest look at what is happening.\n\nWhat is working against you: The entire AI software sector is being repriced. Today, Google Gemini was selected as the backbone of the DoD's GenAI.mil platform, which rattled confidence in Palantir's perceived government moat. RSI is at 37-38, below the 5-day SMA ($133.79), 20-day ($142.38), and 50-day ($165.19), with a bearish MACD. At P/E 213x and PEG 2.30, technicians are right to flag the risk. Stockinvest.us has it on a strong sell.\n\nWhat is working for you: Q4 revenue came in at $1.407B, up 70% year over year. US commercial hit $507M, up 137%. The 2026 guidance of $7.18-7.20B, up 61%, blew past Street expectations. The DHS $1B five-year BPA locks in no-bid procurement across six agencies. DISA's IL5/IL6 edge authorization shortens the defense sales cycle. The UK contract was Palantir's largest ever there. AIP adoption is accelerating, not stalling.\n\nCiti's target is $260. The street consensus is $188, which is 41% above where PLTR is today. At 35% below the 52-week high of $207.52, the case for dollar-cost averaging is not unreasonable if you believe the business fundamentals over the near-term chart."

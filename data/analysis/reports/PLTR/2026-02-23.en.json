    "description": "Palantir builds software platforms that analyze and integrate complex data. Since the launch of AIP (AI Platform), the commercial segment has been growing explosively. Q4 2025 revenue reached $1.407B (+70% YoY), with U.S. commercial revenue hitting $507M (+137% YoY). Recent developments include a DHS $1B 5-year BPA (Blanket Purchase Agreement), an expanded Rackspace AI infrastructure partnership (30 to 250+ engineers, UK Sovereign data centers), and a Mizuho upgrade to Outperform ($195) — but the stock is down 24% in 2026. The Percepta AI lawsuit saw the non-compete injunction denied (only non-solicitation granted), DISA IL5/IL6 on-premises and edge authorization was achieved, and Michael Burry published a $46 bear case — creating an intensely divided bull-bear debate.",

Recent developments include a DHS $1B 5-year BPA (Blanket Purchase Agreement), an expanded AI infrastructure partnership with Rackspace, and a Mizuho upgrade to Buy — but the stock is down 24% in 2026. The Percepta AI lawsuit saw a non-compete injunction denied, while DISA IL5/IL6 authorization was achieved, painting a mixed picture.",

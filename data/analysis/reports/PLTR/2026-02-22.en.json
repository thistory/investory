Q4 2025 revenue reached $1.407B (+70% YoY), with U.S. commercial revenue at $507M (+137% YoY). Recent developments include a DHS $1B 5-year BPA (Blanket Purchase Agreement), expanded AI infrastructure partnership with Rackspace, and a Mizuho upgrade to Buy. However, the stock is down 24% in 2026. The Percepta AI lawsuit saw a non-compete injunction denied, while DISA IL5/IL6 authorization was achieved — a mixed picture overall.",
